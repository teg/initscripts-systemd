Unit files needed to make systemd a drop-in replacement for the traditional Arch Linux initscripts.

The goal is to one day become obsolete.

Functionality
=============

arch-load-modules.service
-------------------------

Parses rc.conf for the modules to be loaded at boot and saves the list where
systemd-load-modules will find it.

arch-daemons generator
----------------------

Creates a systemd unit for every rc script in /etc/rc.d. These will be only
used as fallback, if no native service file exists. Furthermore, if a daemon
is enabled in rc.conf, it will be pulled in by multi-user.target. If no native
systemd service exists for this daemon, the ordering indicated in rc.conf
will be respected.


rc-local{,-shutdown}.service
----------------------------

Runs these legacy scripts at boot/shutdown, respectively.
