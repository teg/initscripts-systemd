Unit files needed to make systemd a drop-in replacement for the traditional Arch Linux initscripts.

The goal is to one day become obsolete.

Functionality
-------------
1) arch-daemons.target: starts the daemons listed in rc.conf, preserving ordering and using rc scripts if no native systemd unit with the same name is found.
2) rc-local{,-shutdown}.service: compatibility with the legacy scripts.
