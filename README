Unit files needed to make systemd a drop-in replacement for the traditional Arch Linux initscripts.

The goal is to one day become obsolete.

Functionality
-------------
1) dmraid.service (FakeRAID)
2) lvm.service (after dmraid has finished)
3) arch-load-modules.service: parses rc.conf for the modules to be loaded at boot and saves the list where systemd-load-modules will find it.
4) arch-daemons.target: starts the daemons listed in rc.conf, preserving ordering and using rc scripts if no native systemd unit with the same name is found.
5) rc-local{,-shutdown}.service: compatibility with the legacy scripts.

TODO: Both dmraid and lvm need testers. The tools do not support hotplugging, so we might need to add some more synchronisation points to avoid races.
